# omgandroidTute

android application written from following the tutorial here 
https://www.raywenderlich.com/56107/make-first-android-app-part-1

Written on xubuntu 14.04 using android studio 2.1 using oracle 
using JRE 1.7 and oracle JVM

Some parts of the tutorial didn't work on the latest android studio 
as some things must have changed since the tutorial was written, but 
mostly things worked straight away.
